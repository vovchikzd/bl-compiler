# ParaCL language compiler
[ParaCL](paracl.pdf) is a toy language to learn making compilers

## Several desired goals
- [ ] lex source into tokens
- [ ] parse tokens into AST
- [ ] compile AST into assembly (since this is only for training goals, x86_64 is enough i think)
- [ ] ??flex lexer and bison parser??
